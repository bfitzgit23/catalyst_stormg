        Ly is a lightweight TUI (Terminal User Interface) display manager for Linux.
        It aims to be simple, fast, and easily configurable. Ly supports various
        desktop environments and window managers, and provides a minimalistic
        yet functional login experience. It's designed to be an alternative to
        heavier graphical display managers while still offering essential features.
