		uscope (pronounced "microscope") is a new graphical debugger for Linux.
		Its goal is to enable you to understand what your system is
		actually doing as quickly and effectively as possible.

		All debugging-related code is written from scratch, i.e.
		parsing ELF/DWARF, handling control of the subordinate process
		(launch, kill, step, continue, etc.), reading data from the
		subordinate's memory/registers and displaying it in a user-friendly
		manner, stack unwinding, etc.
