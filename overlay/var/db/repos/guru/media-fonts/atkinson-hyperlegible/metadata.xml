    Atkinson Hyperlegible is a freely available typeface built around a
    grotesque sans-serif core, intended to be optimally
    legible for readers who are partially visually impaired, with all
    characters maximally distinguishable from one another. It was
    developed by the Braille Institute of America in collaboration with
    Applied Design Works and is available under the SIL Open Font
    License. It won Fast Company's Innovation by Design Award for
    Graphic Design in 2019 and was shortlisted for a graphic design
    award by Dezeen in 2020.
