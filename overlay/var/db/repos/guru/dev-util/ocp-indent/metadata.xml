	<longdescription lang="en">Ocp-indent is based on an approximate, tolerant OCaml parser and a simple stack machine ; this is much faster and more reliable than using regexps. Presets and configuration options available, with the possibility to set them project-wide. Supports most common syntax extensions, and extensible for others.

Includes:
- An indentor program, callable from the command-line or from within editors
- Bindings for popular editors
- A library that can be directly used by editor writers, or just for fault-tolerant/approximate parsing.</longdescription>
