Superfile is a very fancy and modern terminal file manager that can complete the file operations you need!!
It can be said that good-looking is the original intention of superfile, so the entire superfile should be as beautiful as possible.
From basic Hotkey, the entire theme color and even the border Style can be customized.
This file manager allows you to do almost everything you want to do on a file manager.
Multiple panel allows you to view multiple directories at the same time and copy and paste in just a few simple steps without having to return to the main directory.
